- 👋 Hi, It's Nouman Sethi!
I'm a Software Engineer having my bachelor from FAST-NUCES, Islamabad, keen and passionate to explore my domain. I'm a co-creator and maintainer of <WiseTransslator> which is a bi-lingual translator.
You should go and see it once from here. 

- 🌱 Current project ...
I, with my colleagues, Talat Naeem & Nasir Iqbal are in our last year and doing our Final Year Project. 
The idea which we chose for this is Bi-lingual (English-Urdu) Machine Translation System. 

Vision:
Our vision is to create a web application where the user will be provided the option to translate the text. 
Moreover, we're also aiming to provide a free API to the users. 
We want to keep all of it open-source so anyone can benefit from it. 
As Urdu is our National language and there's less work done in this domain. In this way, 
we want to pave the way for new development in this domain in the future. We want to make a contribution to our language.

Our Supervisors:
We are doing this project under the supervision of our respected professors Ms. Mehreen Alam and Mr. Shams Farooq.
